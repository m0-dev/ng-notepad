file. This repository has a ready-to-copy-paste template you can use for all
your projects.

## Getting started

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Contributing

you'd like. Pull requests are warmly welcome.
